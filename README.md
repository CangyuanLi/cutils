# Gotchas

## Dictionaries

What is the difference between

```python
dict1 = dict(zip(["a", "b", "c"], [[]] * 3))
```
and 

```python
dict2 = {key:[] for key in ["a", "b", "c"]}
```
When you print them, both return

```python
{'a': [], 'b': [], 'c': []}
```
But try, for example, 

```python
dict1["a"].append(1)
print(dict1)
dict2["a"].append(1)
print(dict2)
```

Surprisingly, you get

```python
dict1 = {'a': [1], 'b': [1], 'c': [1]}
dict2 = {'a': [1], 'b': [], 'c': []}
```
What happened here? The empty lists in dict1 are actually the same list, so when you change one, you change all of them. You can run into the same trap if you initialize a dictionary with

```python
dict.fromkeys(["a", "b", "c"], [])
```

or if you pass in a mutable object as a default argument to a function.
